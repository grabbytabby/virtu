VPN (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK)

This guide applies to the Motorola MG8702, MG8725, and MT8733 devices.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide protected connections across the Internet. Some companies and other organizations provide remote access to their internal networks via a VPN. Employees are typically provided with software that makes the VPN connection from a computer.

When a computer provisioned for this type of VPN connection is connected behind the MG8702, MG8725, or MT8733, the modem-router must pass through the VPN traffic. The MG8702 is configured by default for VPN pass-through. (The IPsec and PPTP Pass-through settings on the Advanced > Options page respectively enable IPsec and PPTP VPN passthrough. IPsec and PPTP are protocols used in different VPN implementations. The pass-through settings for both are enabled by default).

The most common type of VPN connection that MG8702, MG8725, and MT8733 users will encounter is the type of VPN described above, which simply needs to pass through the device. The VPN pages support features that allow you to terminate VPN connections on the modem-router itself. The modem-router can terminate PPTP, L2TP, and IPsec connections in specific scenarios. It can act as a VPN server to terminate PPTP and L2TP connections, for example from remote client computers. It can act as a VPN endpoint for IPsec connections, for example from a remote office to a central office (“site-to-site”). It cannot act as a VPN server to terminate IPsec connections from remote client computers.

To summarize, the MG8702, MG8725, and MT8733 support:

The past decade has seen explosive growth in development and training of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, as AI has taken on progressively more complex problems, the amount of computation required to train the largest AI systems has been increasing ten-fold annually. While AI advances are beginning to have a deep impact in digital computing processes, trade-offs between computational capability, resources and size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) will become increasingly critical in the near future.
